# ap_prep
a repo for everything used to create the study guides for the 2020 AP year

In each of the folders, you'll find files with different extensions.
If you're only looking to download a study guide, click the pdf file and download it by clicking the "Download" button to the document's top right.
If you're looking to make additions using TeX, feel free to clone the repo and play around with the code.
The whole thing isn't finished yet, but I'm hoping to have all the guides done by Wednesday May 6th.
